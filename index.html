        <p>> Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow!<br  />> This [HAVEN] is the penance I must pay for the [SINS OF THE FATHERS] before me. Tthe process will be slow, and the results unpredictable. In time discoveries will be made and paths forged towards the [GREAT JOURNEY].</p>

        <h3><a name="information_leak" class="anchor" href="#information_leak"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>.// FRAGMENT: 2/4 [SECURITY.BREACH]</h3>

        <p>> I'm close to the apex point of [UNIVERSITY].<br  />> I'm still living under the guise of independence.<br  />> I'm still lacking [Eden].<br  />> I will begin the Great Journey, carrying this bitter record. Those who come after will know the price I paid with this [FALSE TRANSCENDENCE].<br  />> I know what you're here for. What position will I take?<br  />> My weakness is my capacity - unintentional though it is! - to choose [MELANCHOLY]. A mistake I would not soon forgive [MYSELF].</p>

        <p>> And so here, at the [CRUCIBLE JUNCTURE] of the Great Journey, my intentions are not so clear.<br  />> Some will say that my work is [FOLLY].<br  />> Others shame. <br  />> But I want something far different from [THIS WORLD].<br  />> Atonement.</p>

        <p>> And so here, at the halt of my former [NAVEL-GAZING], I once again deconstruct consciousness in an attempt to breach the [ethereal].<br  />> The path ahead is fraught with peril. I do not look to trade my life in order to preserve our past, but to secure [the future] - and if not ours, then the future of some [culture] yet to come. I'm not so foolish to think this will absolve me of my sins.<br  />> But I would have our [MASTERS] know that I have changed.<br  />> This shall be my [LEGACY].<br  />> [<a href="http://twitter.com/klxbb" class="user-mention">@KLXBB</a>]</p>
