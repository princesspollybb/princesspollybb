        <p>> . Reverse the polarity of the neutron flow!<br  />> . I'm basically a giant nerd, and this is where I'll be posting my giant nerd stuff. It'll probably be really ugly underneath but the end products will be pretty as Miranda Kerr.</p>

        <p>> . I'm still studying at [university]. I'm still living at home. I'm still poor. But I'm going to be awesome [someday]. That's pretty much me, as a person. A young twenty-something youth with a ridiculous obsession with 'flat' and 'clean'. It's scary. But scary is cool, right?</p>

        <p>> . My projects are a bit all over the place. Some are for work. Some are for me. Lots of them are UI mockups. Lots of them are also [frustrating]. I'm sure if you do similar work you'll understand. I'll try to post lots of cool iOS mockups, among other things. Once I get cool with parallax scrolling, I intend to do some work on that, too. I also like [commas].</p>
