I'm basically a giant nerd, and this is where I'll be posting my giant nerd stuff. It'll probably be really ugly underneath but the end products will be pretty as Miranda Kerr.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd qtpi/miranda_kerr\r\n$ git fetch bikini\r\n$ git checkout nipples\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee how nerdy that is? It's pretty lame. But really nerdy.\r\n\r\n### ./A_Bit_About_M.e\r\nI'm still studying at university. I'm still living at home. I'm still poor. But I'm going to be awesome someday. That's pretty much me, as a person. A young twenty-something youth with a ridiculous obsession with 'flat' and 'clean'. It's scary. But scary is cool, right?\r\n\r\n### ./A_Bit_About_My_Project.s\r\nMy projects are a bit all over the place. Some are for work. Some are for me. Lots of them are UI mockups. Lots of them are also frustrating. I'm sure if you do similar work you'll understand. I'll try to post lots of cool iOS mockups, among other things. Once I get cool with parallax scrolling, I intend to do some work on that, too. I also like commas.\r\n\r\n### ./A_Bit_About_Contacting_M.e\r\nYou can @mention me on #Twitter using klxbb. You can also email me at . If you have any questions, don't you dare hesitate to contact me. Actually, wait, do hesitate. I don't want stupid **** in my inbox.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
